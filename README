Python 2 script to convert Spotify playlist to mFlow playlist

Usage: 

python2 Flowify.py [mflow username] [mflow password] [mFlow playlist name] [file containing spotify uris]

Your uri file should be created by selecting all files in a spotify playlist within the Spotify client, right 
clicking and selecting copy spotify uris.  These should then be pasted/saved into a text file. 

As the mFlow website only shows 50 flows in a playlist, the script automatically splits larger playlists into 
separate playlists named [name of playlist] part 2, part 3, etc. There is also a hard limit of 100 songs per 
playlist beyond which they are deemed "full", so any workround will have to be at the client end. 

If you're not already an mFlow user, sign up by the following link to earn yourself and the script author £1

PLEASE NOTE

Only songs which have been flowed can be added to a user playlist.  The script will flow the song using your 
account if it can't already find a flow of that song.  So please don't use the script if you have an issue with 
that.

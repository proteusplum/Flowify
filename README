Python 2 script to convert Spotify playlist to mFlow playlist

Usage: 

python2 Flowify.py [mflow username] [mflow password] [mFlow playlist name] [file containing spotify uris]

Your uri file should be created by selecting all files in a spotify playlist within the Spotify client, right 
clicking and selecting copy spotify uris.  These should then be pasted/saved into a text file. 

As the mFlow website only shows 50 flows in a playlist, the script automatically splits larger playlists into 
separate playlists named [name of playlist] part 2, part 3, etc. There is also a hard limit of 100 songs per 
playlist beyond which they are deemed "full", so any workround will have to be at the client end.
